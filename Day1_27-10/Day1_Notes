# What is BeagleBone Black?
BeagleBone Black is a low-cost, community-supported development platform for developers and hobbyists. 
Boot Linux in under 10 seconds and get started on development in less than 5 minutes with just a single USB cable.

# Processor: AM335x 1GHz ARMÂ® Cortex-A8
	512MB DDR3 RAM
	4GB 8-bit eMMC on-board flash storage
	3D graphics accelerator
	NEON floating-point accelerator
	2x PRU 32-bit microcontrollers

# Connectivity
	USB client for power & communications
	USB host
	Ethernet
	HDMI
	2x 46 pin headers

# Software Compatibility
	Debian
	Android
	Ubuntu
	Cloud9 IDE on Node.js w/ BoneScript library
	plus much more

# Beaglebone black board --- .org -----> all details

# Controller vs Proc

# https://www.ti.com/product/AM3359 -- Download

# eMMC ( embedded Multi-Media Controller ) 
	- 4GB - Debian OS
	- 2GB - Angstrom OS (Lite version)

# MyBoard Configuration :
	Part no. of SOC : U5
	Part no. of eMMC : U13
	Proc : XAM3359AZCZI00
	UART : J1
	Boot : S2
	LEDs : D2-D5
	Power : S3
	Reset : S1
	Memory Card : P10
	DDR3 : U12 (Kingston - D2516EC4BXGGB)

# Powering BBB board :
	1. Through Mini USB port - P4
	2. DC power adapter - DC Barrel Plug 5.5mm/2.1mm ( Recommended 5V @ 2A )
	   5V - fixed oper vol, oper curr - 1.2A to 2A

# Connection to Serial Debug with USB to TTL converter 
	Red - +5V
	Black - GND
	Green - TxD
	White - RxD
	
	Connect it cross like RxD to TxD & TxD to RxD 
# Open terminal & install minicom using command
	sudo apt-get install minicom
	Then make some changes using sudo minicom -s

# ( REFER AFREED's NOTES )

# Configuration (Block Diagram) :

	128KB of RAM (64KB of shared RAM & 64KB of SOC RAM)
	176KB of ROM
	32KB L1 & 256KB L2 cache
	S/m bus - Interconnects L3 & L4 (L3 - High s/m bus - High transactions, L4 - Low s/m bus - Peripherals)
	In L3 & L4 - peripherals like SERIAL (6 UARTs, 2 SPIs, 3 I2Cs, USB 2.0, 2 CANs) 
		   - SYSTEM (8 Timers, RTC, eDMA, WDT, PRCM, Crystal Osc - 24MHz(enhanced upto 1GHz using PLL engines),
		   	     JTAG, ADC 12-bit(8 channel), 3 eCAP)
		   - PARALLEL (3(MMC, SD, SDIO), GPIO) 
		   - MEMORY INTERFACE (mDDR(LPDDR), DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L (16-bit 200,266,400,400 MHz),
		                      NAND & NOR (16-bit ECC))

# MMC 
	* MMC0 & MMC1 are parallel transactions ( 8-bits )
	* Shift from MMC0 to MMC1 is using S2; Default is eMMC 
	* MMC0 is connected to Micro SD card P10
	* MMC1 is connected to eMMC U13 - NAND based - 4GB
	* In SCH doc we can get part numbers and what connected to it

# TASK : TO FIND OTHER PART NUMBERS, DEVICES, SCH DIAGRAMS, etc

# Beaglebone Linux Booting Process 
	3 stages are involved in booting process
	 1. RBL : ROM Boot Loader - From reset vector - RBL -> From where to load OS - Diagram in ppt (27/77) - BOOTLOADER STAGE
	    SPL : Sec Prgm Loader - Finds images/bootfiles images (mem loc) - from where to boot - BOOTLOADER STAGE
	    MLO : Mem Loader - If we add mem loc to boot image (Zee image) - then MLO, only Zee image is SPL - BOOTLOADER STAGE
	 2. U-Boot : To load & run the Linux kernel - It will take image from mem loc & do WDT, GPIO initialize, Timers - configs initializations
	 	      After that, handover to Linux - takes help from root filesystem - First thing - Login & pwd - KERNEL STAGE
	 3. USER STAGE : To Linux OS

# Other booting options
	AM335x SOC booting can be done from :
	  NAND flash, NOR flash, USB, eMMC, SD card, Ethernet, UART, SPI
	  That means w ecan keep boot images in any of the memory/peripheral & can be able to boot this SOC.
